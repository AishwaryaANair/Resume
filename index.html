      <h2>About me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My fascination with AI artificial intelligence began
          during my undergraduate studies in computer science at VESIT.
          Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on cutting-edge machine learning projects,
          from developing predictive models to using morphological analysis and dependency trees to craft
          an algorithm to divide clauses.
        <li>
          I'm an advocate for pushing the boundaries
          of AI technology to enhance human lives, whether through
          safer transportation or assisting individuals with disabilities.
          My project called ASSIST elaborates more about the same <a href = #assist> here </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          My hobbies include reading, playing basketball and running.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fun fact: I can speak 6 languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam and some
          Korean that I picked up by watching a lot of their variety shows). So, according to my
          calculations (which may very well be wrong when you're reading this) I can speak to 1.504 billion
          people, which constitutes to about 20% of the world population.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can play the piano, but I am rusty due to the lack of practice.
